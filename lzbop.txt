What else_should 1234 write? Here's a poem:
"Once upon a midnight dreary
While I pondered weak & weary
Over many a quaint & curious volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping
As of someone gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door
'Tis some visitor, I muttered, tapping at my chamber door
Merely this and nothing more."
